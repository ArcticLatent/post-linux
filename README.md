## 🧊 Ubuntu-Specific Features

Ubuntu users get a clean and modern setup automatically:

- 🧹 **Removes Snap packages completely**  
  The script purges Snap and all related services using the included `snap-to-flatpak.sh` helper script.

- 🔄 **Switches to Flatpak**  
  After Snap removal, Flathub is added as the default Flatpak remote, ensuring access to thousands of desktop apps.

- 🌐 **Restores Firefox via official APT repository**  
  Because removing Snap also removes the preinstalled Snap-based Firefox, the script:
  1. Adds Mozilla’s official APT repository and imports its GPG key  
  2. Pins it with high priority for future updates  
  3. Installs the latest **Firefox `.deb`** package system-wide  

  The imported key fingerprint is verified as:

35BAA0B33E9EB396F59CA838C0BA5CE6DC6315A3


Together, this ensures a fully open, Flatpak-friendly Ubuntu environment with a native, up-to-date Firefox browser.
