## 🧊 Ubuntu-Specific Features

Ubuntu users get a clean, optimized, and GPU-ready setup automatically:

- 🧹 **Removes Snap packages completely**  
  The script purges Snap and all related services using the included `snap-to-flatpak.sh` helper script.

- 🔄 **Switches to Flatpak**  
  After Snap removal, Flathub is added as the default Flatpak remote, ensuring access to thousands of desktop apps.

- ⚙️ **Installs NVIDIA drivers intelligently**  
  The script automatically detects your GPU generation and installs the latest compatible driver:  

  - For **RTX 4000 series and newer** → Installs the **latest available NVIDIA Open Kernel Module driver** (e.g., `nvidia-driver-580-open`).  
  - For **RTX 3000 series and earlier** → Installs the **latest proprietary NVIDIA driver** automatically.  
  - If detection fails for any reason, the script gracefully falls back to:  

  ```bash
  sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall

This ensures seamless GPU setup across all modern NVIDIA hardware.

    🌐 Restores Firefox from Mozilla’s official repository (no PPA)
    Because removing Snap also removes the preinstalled Snap-based Firefox, the script reinstalls Firefox directly from Mozilla’s official APT repository, not Ubuntu’s PPAs.
    It:

- Adds Mozilla’s verified APT source and GPG key

- Configures APT pinning to prioritize Mozilla’s version

- Installs the latest Firefox .deb release maintained by Mozilla themselves

    ✅ Verified GPG Key Fingerprint:

    35BAA0B33E9EB396F59CA838C0BA5CE6DC6315A3

Together, this ensures a fully open, Flatpak-friendly Ubuntu environment with a native, GPU-optimized system and up-to-date Firefox browser.
## 🧮 Usage

~~~bash
git clone https://github.com/ArcticLatent/post-linux.git
